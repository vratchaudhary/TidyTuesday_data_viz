# Tidy Tuesday Examples


I like data visualization and Tidy Tuesday is super cool as it gives a chance to create interesting visualization with fun data. Also the community component of Tidy Tuesday is really inspiring. Poeple are creating such amazing data visualizations. There is so much I get to learn from the community. My submissions are below with the link to the code.
